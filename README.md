# IIEC_Docker_Course_Project

 **Mr Vimal Daga** a WORLD RECORD HOLDER initiated with a 
community named as **IIEC** under which he started giving online 
training of some courses for students like us and the course
was totally free of cost. 
Of one of them courses was Docker of which he took 7 sessions
And one session was introductory. After successfully 
completing the course I implemented the knowledge of that
training by creating this project.
